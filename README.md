# Personal Linktree-Style Page © iRobbott

This is my personal landing page, designed to serve as a temporary digital hub hosted on GitHub Pages.  
It features a circular profile photo, a workspace-inspired cover image, horizontal social icons, stylish developer-themed buttons, and a share option for easy distribution.  

The purpose of this project is to centralize my links, showcase my work, and provide a simple way to connect with me online.
